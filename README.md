# lazy-json
This Scala Maven project provides an example of how to read a large 
JsonArray from a file using Gson Google lib, Scala Stream, and tail-rec 
funtions in Scala-2.10

This project is inspired from https://github.com/acanimal/java-json-examples
and the data we use here are forked from the later project
